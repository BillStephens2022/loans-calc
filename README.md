# Loan Accounting & Risk Examples

## *** This is a work in process *** - ultimately will be building backend to handle viewing all entered examples, also will be adding error handling on forms and fine tuning calculations. CSS Styling is still pretty basic and not yet responsive for mobile.  Will also be adding pages to explain various Corporate Loan concepts (descriptions of loan types, loan ecomics, loan features, etc). So....MUCH more to come!

This Corporate Loan Accounting Training application is built using Next.js / React.js.

So far, this is what has been built:

On the Learning page, users can toggle between topics to learn more about corporate loans.

On the Loan Accounting page, users can enter sample loan transaction terms - once entered, journal entries will be generated as well as a balance sheet and off balance sheet view of the entered transaction.

On the Fronting page, users can enter sample loan transaction terms - once entered, the application will calculate potential fronting exposure risks based on details entered. This calculates Swingline & Issued LC
fronting risks based on the underlying loan facility's sublimits.

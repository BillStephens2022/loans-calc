# Loan Accounting & Risk Examples

## *** This is a work in process *** 

## Description
This application is built using Next.js / React.js and MongoDB.

The app is a Corporate Loan educational tool covering various topics describing loan types, facility types, various types of loan economics (interest/fees), assignments / participations, etc.  The application allows you to enter example loan transactions so that you can view the accounting (balance sheet / off balance sheet view, journal entries).  It also allows you to calculate fronting risk for swingline loans and lc issuance - banks need to disclose the risks arising from these fronting arrangements as part of their off balance sheet disclosures.  

On the Learning page, users can toggle between topics to learn more about corporate loans.

On the Loan Accounting page, users can enter sample loan transaction terms - once entered, journal entries will be generated as well as a balance sheet and off balance sheet view of the entered transaction.

On the Fronting page, users can enter sample loan transaction terms - once entered, the application will calculate potential fronting exposure risks based on details entered. This calculates Swingline & Issued LC
fronting risks based on the underlying loan facility's sublimits.

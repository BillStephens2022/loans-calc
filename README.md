An education application covering Corporate Loans built with NextJS/ReactJS, TypeScript and MongoDB. 

The Learning page covers various loan related topics including types of loan deals, facility types, econocomics (interest/fees), assignments/participations, etc. 

The Accounting page has examples (stored in the MongoDB database) where you can add new examples, and view the balance sheet and off balance sheet of the portfolio. Click on an individual example and see its journal entries and balance sheet/off balance sheet impacts. 

On the Fronting page, see examples of loan facilities that have fronting risks (where lender is the Swingline Lender and/or Letter of Credit Issuer) and view the calculated fronting risks. Enter your own example to see what the fronting risk calculations would be. 

And finally test your knowledge with a multiple choice quiz.
